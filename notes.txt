Finally got to read the version from Dell (paperback, 1967). My eyesight is not what it used to be, so to read the rather small print, 
I had to get out a very powerful pair of glasses (4.0). 
That said, I was determined NOT to read any reviews or look at any adaptations until I had read the book in its entirety for myself!
-- My one gripe about Dickens is that he uses multiple names for the same characters. Most distracting. 
-- About the book itself: To get the full picture of everything that is going on, I know I will have to read the novel more than once. -- Truthfully, 
this is a book that is literally impossible to put down. 
I do not tend to think of Dickens as a writer of romances.
I am compelled to compare the plot line here with that of the classic silent movie Orphans of the Storm" (don't miss it). 
The stories in both are absolutely replete with romance! Be still my beating heart! -- 
"Cities" as a classic that must be read in order for someone to get a full appreciation of great literature in the English language.
